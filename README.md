## Why PromptHub?

As applications increasingly rely on Large Language Models, prompts become an important part of the software stack.

Yet most developers still store prompts inside source code, scattered text files, or notebooks, making them difficult to organize, version, search, and reuse.

PromptHub is an attempt to solve that problem through a lightweight REST API built entirely in Go.

The project is also a hands-on exploration of backend engineering fundamentals, including HTTP servers, REST APIs, JSON serialization, routing, request handling, and clean project architecture.

    "category": "Productivity",
    "model": "GPT-4.1",
    "tags": [
        "summary",
        "meetings"
    ]
}
```
